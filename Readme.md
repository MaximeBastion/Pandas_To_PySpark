# Pandas to PySpark
In this project we will revisit the 'Titanic' project made using Pandas and do it in parallel using PySpark.
This project can act as a comparison of how to achieve certain tasks using Pandas VS using PySpark.
PySpark allows us to process much larger datasets than Pandas.

Notes:
* I am starting the process of learning PySpark.
* This project will contain much less documentation about the Titanic dataset as it is focused on the code.
* The 'variables exploration' section will be much shorter as we skip code repetitions.
* We will sometimes convert PySpark DataFrames to Pandas DataFrame for clarity. We will only do so for small portions of the dataset as to not defeat the point of using PySpark over Pandas. The Machine Learning Section will be done using a Pandas DataFrame and Scikit-learn as I anyway cannot apply models on datasets large enough for PySpark to be necessary.
